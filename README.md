# Crux Agent

Crux Agent is a cross-platform AI voice agent designed to run on multiple devices, including PCs, phones, and tablets. The goal is to create an open agent system where users can contribute and share function calls, effectively building a decentralized, community-driven AI assistant akin to a home Jarvis.

## Features
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, PC, etc.)
- Uses [LiveKit](https://github.com/livekit/livekit) for real-time communication
- Business logic powered by [Crux](https://github.com/redbadger/crux)
- AI processing via:
  - [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI)
  - [OpenedAI-Whisper](https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-whisper)
  - [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
- Open function call system for community contributions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
